                    BMI calculator
                    <p><b>Abstract : </b><br>
                        BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on height and weight and is
                        intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person
                        has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the
                        calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight,
                        overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary
                        based on factors such as region and age and are sometimes further divided into subcategories
                        such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have
                        significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a
                        useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table
                        below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.<br>

                    <p><b>Abstract : </b>
                        a plagiarism detector is a software tool or program that is designed to identify and highlight
                        instances of plagiarism in written content. Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work
                        or ideas without giving proper credit or attribution. It is a serious ethical violation in
                        academic and professional settings and can result in severe consequences such as failing a
                        course or losing a job.<br>
